# deobfuscate-js

It's a personal project for deobfuscating javascript files.

The project is unstable and has very limited functionality, and new features will only be added when I encounter new requirements.

## How to use

```bash
npm install
npx ts-node ./src/convert.ts <obfuscated js file> [dest file]
```
